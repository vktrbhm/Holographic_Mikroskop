For physical mounting, see [03-07 round mount.md]()

Unscrew the lens from the laser, we need a divergent beam.
There may be a tiny screw in the side of the laser, near the lens.
After loosening this screw, the lens is easy to turn.
Warning: The lens thread may be greased.

Please make sure your are allowed to operate the laser, and familiarize yourself with basic laser safety.
The laser we suggest is a class 2 laser, and by removing the lens, it becomes divergent.
We think this makes the device even safer, but cant guarantee this.
Put the supplied yellow safety sticker somewhere on the device.

The laser can be powered from a USB port - and the RPI has some.
You can simply cut open and old USB cable.
Usually, there will be four wires inside: black, red, and two other colors.
Solder the black (ground) and red (+5V) wires to the same colors on the laser.
