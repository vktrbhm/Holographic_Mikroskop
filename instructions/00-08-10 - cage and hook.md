The reference assemly uses two `cage.cage_circumference` at the ends to keep everything together.
You can use additional parts to make the setup even more rigid.

The `cage.board_hook()` can be used to hang the setup from a wall instead of mounting it to a surface.
Adjust `hook_opening` to fit the thickness of the wall/door/... you are hanging the setup from.
The flat faces on the `cage.cage_circumference` ensure that the setup rests against the wall.
