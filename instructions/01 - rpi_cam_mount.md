Remove the tiny objective from the camera.
Usually, a tool is included to turn the objective: if you unscrew the objective far enough, it will fall out.

Fasten the camera to the smooth wide of the printed part, with the camera facing _into_ the rectangular hole in the part.
The flat cable should point towards the clips, so that the edges of the camera board match the printed rectangle.
Use four screws (M2.5 or M2.3).
