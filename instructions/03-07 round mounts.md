The objective, the condensor lens and the laser are mounted into similar round mounts.
If you are using parts with different diameters than the reference_assembly, modify the printable parts accordingly.

The lens and objective mounts have a little ridge inside, so there is a correct, easy side to insert the lens from.

The mounts will probably be tight enough to keep the parts from falling out, but an M3x10 screw and a hex nut can be use to really tighten the clamp.
If you plan on moving the setup a lot, using the screw is a really good idea.
